Game of Life uses a 2d array of values to represent "life" in a given cell.
Certain rules are applied to determine whether life continues or death occurs.
These rules are as follows: <br><br>

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation. <br>
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. <br>
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. <br>
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. <br>
