<p>This is a program that allows the user to take an input file (converted from a .png/.jpg) consistant of 3 values for RGB
and depending on the user selection will either flip the image horizontally, vertically and/or grayscale the image. All
changes are then saved to output.txt which allows the user to convert back to .png/.jpg image files.</p>
